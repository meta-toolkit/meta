  In my opinion, itÅfs important for students to have a part-time job. But I argue that the job must be a proper part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a proper part-time job. For instance, a proper part-time job can help students to realize that no success comes from noting. It also enables students to be independent and build up their self-confidence. In addition, a proper part-time can make the students out of the ivory tower and give them lots of opportunities to know more of themselves and the society. In the same time, students can realize their personal value in society by having a proper part-time job.     Of course, as we all known, everything has two sides. If we do not know the balance between part-time and learning, something bad will occur to us. In other words, an improper part-time job will bring many disadvantages to us. For example, an improper part-time job must occupy studentsÅf time and make them just pay their attention on money but not what they should to learn.   In a word, a part-time job is important for the students, but the students must keep a good balance between part-time and their learning.   
With the development of the living conditions and qualities, quite more and more students have the opportunity to go to college .Parents and the public are concerned with college studentsÅf development .A great many people start to pay more attention on part-time job. Some people hold the view that part-time jobs will affect studentsÅf study in college. In my opinion, a part-time job can help a lot. First of all, knowledge should be put into proactive. Through a part-time job, we can better understand what we have learned in college. Also, we can gain much more than what we have learned from books. Moreover a part-time job is a bridge which connects the college period and the career period after graduation. Some students will feel to have no direction when they graduate of they have never had part-time jobs in college. Since fierce competition is waiting for them, they have little time to adjust to the new environment. IT is not easy for then to learn how companies and working. Yet,Å@if they once had part-time jobs. They will better get involved in the jobs they do. Last but not least, a part-time job can help one build up social relationship and will make one feel more confident.  The modern society needs talents that develop in all directions.  What we learn from textbooks is far less than enough. A part-time job will make up our disadvantages effectively.    
Recently, I found some people are discussing warmly on weather it is important for college student to have a part-time job. Someone think it is a waste of time for student who should spend much of in studying while some believe that it is a good chance for student to get the knowledge on how to earn money and how to live in the society which they have to learn when they leave school.   To my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it is a good chance for student raise their ability of living in the society. As we all know, during the recent years, it is hard for some student who just left school to find a good job since the company do not admit they ability by a piece of paper since the education system is not trustful. At this time, if they show something they got in the part-time job, it would be very useful for them. Meanwhile, as a college student myself, I find that we have a lot of spare time after finishing the courses required, the part-time job in spare time can enlarge our abilities of communication, teamwork spirit and so on.   However, we should have a clear mind on the priority, as a student, the first mission is learning, part-time job can help us a lot, but if you failed a lot, you will still face many problems,. Beyond this, pay more attention with the contract when you what to sign in a part-time job. 
Different people hold different views on part-time jobs for college students. Although more and more people focus their attention on part-time jobs, I donÅft think we should do part-time jobs in college. We fell happy and proud that we go to the colleges we have long been dreaming for after great efforts. However we are faced with more challenges. The subjects we study are not easy to grasp. We also need to develop social relationships. Still, we need to take part in many competitions. Moreover, there are quite a lot of books lying in the library we need to go though. It is really a great opportunity for us to develop ourselves in all aspects. We are supplied with so many chances that we have no time to do part-time jobs. It would be better that we go out when we graduate. In conclusion, we should cherish the golden time in college for self-learning and self-developing. What the most important is that we would better keep busy every minute to make each day count in order to fulfill our dream and contribute to our society better. So do not do things that distract our attention from studying. Make better use of every day to make ourselves more and more independent powerful.
